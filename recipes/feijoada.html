    <h1>Feijoada</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Feijoada is a traditional Brazilian dish, widely regarded as the country's national dish. It is a hearty, flavorful stew made with black beans, a variety of salted meats (such as pork, beef, and sausages), and spices. The dish is typically slow-cooked to allow the flavors to meld together, resulting in a rich, savory meal. Feijoada is often served with white rice, sautéed collard greens, and orange slices, which help balance the richness of the stew. It is traditionally enjoyed on special occasions or during festive gatherings, especially on Saturdays, as part of a communal meal.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>500g of black beans</li>
        <li>500g of pork (such as pork shoulder, ribs, or bacon)</li>
        <li>300g of beef (such as dried beef, carne seca, or smoked sausage)</li>
        <li>2 sausages (chorizo or linguiça)</li>
        <li>2 to 3 smoked sausages (calabresa or paio)</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>4 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the black beans and soak them in water for at least 8 hours or overnight to soften the beans and reduce cooking time.</li>
        <li>Cut the pork (ribs, bacon, or shoulder), beef (dried beef or carne seca), and sausages into bite-sized pieces. If using dried or salted meat, soak or rinse it for a few hours to remove excess salt.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped onion and garlic, and sauté until softened and fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the pork, beef, and sausages to the pot and brown the meats on all sides to develop flavor.</li>
        <li>Add the soaked black beans to the pot with the browned meats.</li>
        <li>Cover with water (about 1-2 inches above the beans) and add the bay leaves.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 2 to 3 hours, stirring occasionally. Add more water if needed to keep the beans submerged.</li>
        <li>Once the beans are tender and the stew has thickened, taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>If you prefer a thicker stew, mash a portion of the beans with a spoon or potato masher.</li>
    </ol>

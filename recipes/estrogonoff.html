    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Brazilian Beef Stroganoff is a deliciously creamy and comforting dish made with tender beef slices cooked in a rich sauce of cream, onions, and mushrooms. This variation often includes a touch of ketchup and mustard for a slightly tangy and flavorful twist, giving it a distinct Brazilian flair. The dish is traditionally served with white rice and crispy potato sticks (batata palha) on top, adding texture and crunch. It's perfect for a family meal or a special gathering.</p>
